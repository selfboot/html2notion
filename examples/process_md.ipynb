    "[Why do we have rate limits?](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/overview)\n",
    "Rate limits are a common practice for APIs, and they're put in place for a few different reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They help protect against abuse or misuse of the API. For example, a malicious actor could flood the API with requests in an attempt to overload it or cause disruptions in service. By setting rate limits, `OpenAI` can prevent this kind of activity.\n",
    "- Rate limits help ensure that everyone has fair access to the API. If one person or organization makes an excessive number of requests, it could bog down the API for everyone else. By throttling the number of requests that a single user can make, OpenAI ensures that the most number of people have an opportunity to use the API without experiencing slowdowns.\n",
    "- Rate limits can help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure. If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users.\n",
